# WorldStats - Become more knowledgable of the world around you
Look up statistics on each country or each continent. Countries may also be ranked by certain topics such as population, area, GDP, etc. 
---
## Setting It Up

    Install WAMP and go to C:\wamp\www\. 
    Once inside this directory, either download the zip file of repository (and extract) or do 
    git clone https://github.com/eptikhonov/WorldStats.git in command prompt/terminal.
    
    Start WAMP and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php
    Click import, then select the worldstats.sql file and click go.
    
    Open up the index.php file and change the $username & $password to your SQL server configuration. I kept both values default to
    what WAMP has.
    
## Running the Website Interface
    
    Go to 'http://localhost/WorldStats/index.php' in your preferred web browser to test the web interface.
