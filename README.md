---
## Set Up

    Install WAMP and go to C:\wamp\www\
    Once inside this directory, either download the zip file of repository (and extract) or do 
    git clone https://github.com/eptikhonov/WorldStats.git in command prompt/terminal.
    
    Start WAMP and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php
    Click import, then select the worldstats.sql file and click go.
    
    Open up the index.php file and change the $username & $password to your SQL server configuration. I kept both values default to
    what WAMP has.
    
## Running the Website UI
    
    Go to 'http://localhost/WorldStats/index.php' in your preferred web browser to test the web interface.
